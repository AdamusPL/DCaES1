-- Vhdl test bench created from schematic C:\Users\lab\Desktop\Lab4\zad3\sch3.sch - Tue Nov 07 08:34:07 2023
--
-- Notes: 
-- 1) This testbench template has been automatically generated using types
-- std_logic and std_logic_vector for the ports of the unit under test.
-- Xilinx recommends that these types always be used for the top-level
-- I/O of a design in order to guarantee that the testbench will bind
-- correctly to the timing (post-route) simulation model.
-- 2) To use this template as your testbench, change the filename to any
-- name of your choice with the extension .vhd, and use the "Source->Add"
-- menu in Project Navigator to import the testbench. Then
-- edit the user defined section below, adding code to generate the 
-- stimulus for your design.
